# --------- Challenge: Vehicle Factory ---------

"""
Create a Vehicle Factory that produces different types of vehicles. 
Each vehicle should have specific properties and behaviors.

ðŸ“‹ Requirements:
1- Abstract Class:

    Vehicle (with an abstract method specifications()).

2- Subclasses:
    Implement the following vehicle types:

    Car â€“ Prints: "Car: 4 wheels, max speed 200 km/h"
    Bike â€“ Prints: "Bike: 2 wheels, max speed 100 km/h"
    Truck â€“ Prints: "Truck: 6 wheels, max speed 120 km/h"
    Vehicle Factory:

3- VehicleFactory should return the correct vehicle object:

    "car" â†’ Car
    "bike" â†’ Bike
    "truck" â†’ Truck

4- Bonus (Optional but Fun!):

    If an unknown vehicle type is requested, raise an error message: "Unknown vehicle type: {type}".

# --------- Challenge: Smart Home Device Factory ---------
"""
You will create a Smart Home Factory that produces different types of smart devices. 
Each device will have unique actions it can perform.

ðŸ“‹ Requirements:
1- Abstract Class:

    SmartDevice with two abstract methods:
    turn_on()
    turn_off()
    
2- Subclasses (Concrete Devices):

    SmartLight:
    turn_on() â†’ "Smart Light is ON"
    turn_off() â†’ "Smart Light is OFF"
    SmartThermostat:
    turn_on() â†’ "Thermostat set to 22Â°C"
    turn_off() â†’ "Thermostat turned OFF"
    SmartDoorLock:
    turn_on() â†’ "Door is LOCKED"
    turn_off() â†’ "Door is UNLOCKED"
    
3- Factory Class:

    SmartDeviceFactory should create devices based on the following input:
    "light" â†’ SmartLight
    "thermostat" â†’ SmartThermostat
    "doorlock" â†’ SmartDoorLock
    If the device type is unknown, raise a ValueError with the message:
    "Unknown device type: {device}"
    
4- Bonus Challenge (Optional but Fun!):

    Add a status attribute to track whether the device is currently ON or OFF.
    Create a get_status() method to report the device's current state.
